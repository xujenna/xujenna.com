<p>
The first-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i), which is typically administered in-person over 4-8 weeks. However, trained professionals are few and far between, with an estimated 659 behavioral sleep medicine providers in the US—19% living in California and New York—and many with waitlists of 6 months or more, and out-of-pocket costs averaging $1200 USD.</p>
<p>
Several digital versions of CBT-i have been created to address the need for accessibility, but low adherence rates are common, with the vast majority of participants failing to complete entire programs as designed. Additionally, many of these digital services require insurance coverage, employer benefits, and/or appointments, which severely limits access.
</p>
<p>
Our goal was to create a low-cost, consumer-facing, evidence-based, and efficacious insomnia intervention that anyone with a mobile phone can access.

<div class="type_test" id="description_text">
<p>
As both the product designer and engineer, I spearheaded the development of Sleepbot, drawing heavily on my experience at Mindstrong, where I witnessed the limitations of mobile app solutions for Medicaid and Medicare populations with serious mental illness. My learnings from our extensive UXR and collaborations with clinical stakeholders formed the foundation of my design work for Sleepbot; remembering how Mindstrong's users struggled to use our mobile app motivated us to choose SMS as our medium of care delivery—SMS and language being ubiquitous technologies we all use every day.
</p>
<p>
Collaborating with a clinical psychologist and digital interventions expert, we translated CBT-i into an automated, text-based program that didn't require clinician involvement.

<b>Conversational interface over text messaging</b>
</p><p>
Mobile apps require a baseline digital literacy and rely on pull interventions, placing the burden of care management entirely on the user. This makes little sense for users with impaired functioning (imagine how you felt the day after your last all-nighter). By using SMS to deliver push interventions, Sleepbot makes a notoriously difficult therapeutic protocol as easy as getting text reminders, breaking down CBT-i strategies into manageable, actionable messages throughout the day.

<b>Daily measurement</b>
</p><p>Users maintain a daily sleep diary, tracking their nightly sleep patterns, behaviors, and any issues that arise. This consistent data collection forms the basis for sleep restriction and personalized interventions.

	“It was really useful to have the adapting sleep times and the checkins each morning. It made me more aware of my sleep for sure."<br><span class="attribution">— Canada, 30-40 years old</span>

</p>
<p class="subhead">
<b>Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions</b>
<p>
Tailored reminders about relevant desirable behaviors, sent at times when the user should be doing them, means the user has to do little more than follow instructions—making healthy habit building nearly effortless.<br>

	<b>Clinical Validation</b>
	</p><p>
	A feasibility study with 50 participants over an 8-week period validated our approach:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Severe fatigue reduced 73%</li>
		<li>Impaired functioning due to fatigue reduced 63%</li>
		<li>Time required to fall sleep reduced 45%</li>
		<li>Clinically significant anxiety reduced 92%</li>
		<li>Clinically significant depression reduced 62%</li>
		<li>8-week daily engagement: 80%</li>
		<li>8-week adherence: 92%</li>
		<li>Improvement in 2-3 weeks</li>

	<p class="subhead">
	<b>Real-World Validation</b>
	</p><p>
	Feedback from the study drove iterations ahead of the public launch, which maintained high engagement rates even in real-world settings—empowering users to enact lasting behavior change. In a public effectiveness trial with 3000+ users in 130+ countries, users had an average engagement rate of 71%.</p>
