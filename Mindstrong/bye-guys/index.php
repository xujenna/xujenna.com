<p>Maybe I have no emotional boundaries, but I LOVE MY COWORKERS!! My team at Mindstrong had become no less than family to me, which made it all the more heartbreaking to watch them go. To distract myself from the pain, and give myself a proper platform for a heartfelt goodbye (Zoom is not it), I created the digital version of those physical cards that you'd pass around the office during non-pandemic times. Yes, I know some version of this already exists on the internet, and yes, we've used them before, but they... are not up to my standards. I'm sorry, but my fam deserves better! We are designers!</p>
