<p>To say a heartfelt goodbye to my departing coworkers/distract myself from the pain of everyone leaving their jobs during the pandemic, I created the digital version of those physical cards that you'd pass around the office during pre-pandemic times.</p>
<p>We purchased the domain <span style="font-family:monospace">youarereally.cool</span> so that everyone could have their own vanity link (ie, <span style="font-family:monospace">youarereally.cool/jenna</span>). We eventually saw purchases outside of our own workplaces as well, because turnover is sad!</p>
<p>After a few years and leaving my own job to return to freelance, I discontinud this service, but you can view the original version <a href="https://xujenna.com/bye-qt/" target="new">here</a>.</p>
<p>
Made with vanilla js and Firebase's Realtime Database (for messages) and Storage (for photo/gif uploadsâ€”very important).
