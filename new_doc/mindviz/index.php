    <p>I'm particularly interested in <a href="https://xujenna.com/speakmemory/" target="new">passively collected data on our behavior and bodies</a>, what it might say about our mental health and emotional lives, and <a href="https://xujenna.com/allegoryOf/" target="new">how we might use those insights to live more intentionally</a>. Around a year after joining Mindstrong, I had the opportunity to form an R&D squad dedicated to exploring this topic on behalf of our clinicians and their patients.</p>
    <p>Thanks to our all-star team of data scientists, we were sitting on a veritable gold mine of rigorously tested and meaningful datastreams and experiments, utterly untouched by—even unknown to—the rest of the company. I had the privilege of working closely with these authors, as well as clinical experts, to determine their work's potential for clinical utility, how it might be expressed visually, how it might facilitate existing workflows—and guiding these leads from concept to development.</p>

    <p>Our VP of Research had been refining a sleep prediction model based on our existing smartphone sensor inputs, which our clinicians easily identified as having the most obvious clinical utility; self-reported sleep data is not normally accurate, and sleep journals are difficult to keep consistently.</p>
    <p>The issue, as with most of our datastreams, was that daily sleep/wake predictions was TMI, even for clinicians with patients struggling specifically with sleep—they barely had time to even review their own notes prior to a session. On top of that, longitudinal, quantitative, predictive data is not normally available for use in therapy, so naturally none of our clinicians were trained to integrate such tools into their workflows. The dashboard would not only have to summarize the data, but interpret it into actionable insights for quick user consumption.</p>
    <p>But how can a dashboard apply clinical judgement? Not very well, but we could at least do the prerequisite legwork. I interviewed clinicians about their process—what did they need to know about their patients, and why? Their responses were prioritized to the top of the information hierarchy.</p>
    <p>Yes, we still included most of the dataset in all its granular glory, in case clinicians found something unexpectedly useful. We also provided multiple avenues for providing feedback on it in the UI, from the general dashboard itself to individual data points.</p>
    <p>The following prototype was piloted for three weeks with clinicians working with patients on their sleep. It features a top layer of interpreted and clinically relevant stats, meant as potential conversation starters with patients. Once started, clinicians can drill down into the data if needed.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the efforts and feedback of our participants, we were able to confidently streamline the sleep dashboard to the following form:</p>

    <p>Clearly much easier to read, without losing any of the granularity. Preparations were made for a second pilot in mid-2021.</p>
